#### Learning in the process 📖💻

This app was developed as my portfolio project after completing the Codaisseur Academy in Amsterdam, the Netherlands 💻

The following technologies were used to make it possible CSS | React with Redux | Express | Rest API | SQL | JWT | bcrypt

As any other, this project is not completely finished, but in continous evolution 🧬
